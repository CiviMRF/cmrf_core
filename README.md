# CMRF (Proof-of-Concept)
CMRF is a CiviCRM remote integration toolkit. This repository is a **Drupal module** wrapping the core.

# Install
Currently:

 1. Checkout https://github.com/CiviMcRestFace/CMRF_Abstract_Core
 1. ``> cd cmrf_core``
 1. ``ln -s ../path/to/CMRF_Abstract_Core/CMRF CMRF``

Obviously, we should be using composer... Feel free to contribute.
